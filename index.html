        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, we were asked to support filtering and sorting
            through React by developing a list-based interface. Before getting started though,
            we did some research by reviewing and comparing existing list-based interfaces.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Competitive Comparison Chart</h2>
        <p>
            I chose 3 existing websites: BruKnow, Blackmilk, and Spotify. 
        </p>
        <p>
            BruKnow is Brown’s library catalog, a database of all the physical and online research resources available at our school. BlackMilk is an online clothing store that ships worldwide, known for their collaborations with companies like Sanrio or Nintendo. Finally, Spotify is a music streaming platform in which users can listen to songs and save them to playlists.
        </p>

                    <img src="chart.png" class="photo" alt="Screenshot of Version A" width="50%" height = "auto">

            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The presence of a filtering system is especially useful for favoriting systems that would expect to contain a large number of items, like plenty of saved research articles when writing a paper or many songs in a playlist. The type of filtering will depend on the website: for example, Spotify’s ability to filter alphabetically by artist’s name is helpful because you may remember the names of your favorite artists and want all their songs together, but is less helpful for BruKnow where you may only have one research article by a particular author, and sorting all the articles by author name doesn’t particularly group them in any favorable way. However, BruKnow’s labeling system is especially helpful in being able to make your own groupings and be able to sort with them later: this feature would be helpful for other websites in which users would routinely come back to their favorites list and need to sort through them or refresh themselves on why the items are there. However, the favoriting system will depend largely on the nature of the items: for example, it doesn’t make sense to have multiple copies of the same research article in your favorites list, but it would make sense to have multiple of the same clothing item in your shopping cart.

        <h2>The Adventurer's Guild</h2>
        <p>
            Now with the research done, it was time to get started on brainstorming my own ideas for a list-based interface.
            I have recently been playing a lot of Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, so I thought it would be a cute idea
            to draw up each of our characters and feature them as potential party members as a mock website showing
            adventurers for hire. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each character would have their own class (either a Paladin, Wizard, Fighter, Ranger, or Bard) and role (Support, Utility, or Damage), and could be filtered according to these categories.
            Additionally, each character would have a level (between 1-20) and could be sorted by their level number in ascending or descending order. If you wanted to add 
            a character to your party, all you'd have to do is click a button and they'd show up in your aggregated list of party members!
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting a rough mock-up sketched out, it was time to code!
